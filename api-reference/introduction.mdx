## Welcome

CCTP Explorer provides an array of API endpoints organized around REST for community users and developers to quickly access data and information about the CCTP ecosystem.

Our API features predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts form-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and adheres to standard HTTP response codes, authentication methods, and verbs.

## CCTP Protocol

Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) is a permissionless on-chain utility that facilitates USDC transfers securely between blockchains via native burning and minting. It is available on mainnet for Arbitrum, Avalanche, Base, Ethereum, Noble, OP Mainnet, Polygon PoS, and Solana.
