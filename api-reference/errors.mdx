EigenExplorer API returns machine readable error codes, human readable error messages and a link to the docs for more information.

Here is how an error response looks like:

```json
{
  "status": 400,
  "body": {
    "errors": ["Invalid startDate. Must be a unixtimestamp."]
  }
}
```

## Error Codes

Here is a list of all error codes EigenExplorer API returns:

### `bad_request`

- **Status:** 400
- **Problem:** The request is malformed, either missing required fields, using wrong datatypes, or being syntactically incorrect.
- **Solution:** Check the request and make sure it is properly formatted.

### `unauthorized`

- **Status:** 401
- **Problem:** The request has not been applied because it lacks valid authentication credentials for the target resource.
- **Solution:** Make sure you are using the correct API key or access token.

### `forbidden`

- **Status:** 403
- **Problem:** The server understood the request, but is refusing to fulfill it because the client lacks proper permission.
- **Solution:** Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the resource.

### `internal_server_error`

- **Status:** 500
- **Problem:** The server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request.
- **Solution:** Try again later. If the problem persists, contact support.
